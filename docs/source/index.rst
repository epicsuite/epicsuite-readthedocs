Welcome to the EPIC Suite documentation
=======================================

This is a collection of tools, algorithms and viewers for genomics data, created by the EPIC project at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Broad knowledge of epigenetic regulation of host-pathogen interactions would greatly advance our ability to predict pathogens that have high potential to cause the next global scale catastrophe or pandemic. Although recent progress has been made, scientists and decision makers currently lack methods to quickly compare and identify pathogen-induced changes to host genomes to understand susceptibility and resiliency. This repository includes the toolset developed to address the analysis and visualization needs for extreme scale epigenetics data.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
